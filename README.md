# Learnify
Learnify is an intelligent, AI-powered study application designed to accelerate learning by transforming static PDF documents into a suite of dynamic, interactive study materials. At its core, Learnify leverages the Groq API with the Llama 3.1 model to analyze uploaded content, automatically extracting key concepts to generate tailored flashcards and multiple-choice quizzes. This allows students to move beyond passive reading and engage directly with their course material through interactive study sessions. The platform includes a flashcard mode for mastering key terms and a quiz mode that provides immediate feedback, complete with AI-generated explanations for incorrect answers to deepen understanding. Beyond simple content conversion, Learnify features an AI Test Planner that creates structured, day-by-day study schedules based on the user's notes and a specified exam date. These plans include daily topics, detailed breakdowns, estimated study times, and curated YouTube search queries to supplement learning. All user activity is tracked on a personal dashboard, which provides analytics on study time, flashcard mastery, and quiz performance, enabling students to monitor their progress and identify areas that require further attention.
